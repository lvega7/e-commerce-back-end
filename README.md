# E-commerce Back End 

For this project I used mysql2, sequelize, dontenv, and express. I updated the models with what information I wanted for each table. I updated the API routes so thati can acess all of my Categories, Products, and Tags. With the routes i can go into them by just the ID respectively. I made the different models associate to one another and used ProductTag.js to link my products and tags together. I also included references from one model to another. 
I created api routes to create, update and delete information from a table.When running it in insomnia I can see the different GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests that i made.
